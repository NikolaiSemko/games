                <p>My name is John Widjaja and I'm the defacto team leader of Team 10. For this project, I created the flappybird clone, 
                    I also implemented the random game link in the top right of the screen.</p>

                   <p> Challenges I faced while creating the game was hit detection, moving elements across the screen, calculating the score 
                       and actually creating images on the canvas to animate them. Creating the start screen was also challenging for me, 
                       as I am new to using canvas.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm also fairly new to being a team lead, so some of the challenges was 
                    co-ordination between team members and setting deadlines.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm glad I had the opportunity to work on this project with my team members, and hopefully I can work with them again in 
                    another project.</p>

                    <p>Once again, I would like to thank my wonderful team members for contributing to this project, and the professors for 
                    challenging us on creating something unique.</p>

                    <p>ps. (Lets make something more easier next time!)</p>
