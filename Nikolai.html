                <p>My name is Nikolai. I am not new to programming, but almost new to web development. I just love web
                    development. And since I came into web development from the top to down (that is, from languages
                    ​​such as C++, C, Assembler, Java, etc., and not from HTML and CSS), I especially like to program in
                    JS.
                </p>

                    In this interesting project, I made a Space Shooter game and helped Pardeeep with the Snake
                    game. These games are fully implemented on JS canvas, with the exception of the spaceship, which is
                    made on an SVG element. I also implemented the work with cookies. Cookies remember not only the
                    username but also all records in games. It is also possible to generate a PDF file with brief
                    information about achievements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had an amazing team and we worked like clockwork. Thank you all
                    for putting up with my terrible English.
